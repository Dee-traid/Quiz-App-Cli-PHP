# PHP CLI Quiz Management System

A command-line quiz application built with PHP (OOP) and PostgreSQL.  
This project demonstrates backend fundamentals such as authentication, database design, secure password handling, and timed user interactions — all within a terminal environment.

---

##  Problem Statement

Many quiz platforms focus on web interfaces, but few demonstrate how backend systems can function independently of a UI.  
This project solves that by implementing a **fully interactive quiz system via the command line**, focusing on logic, security, and data integrity.
